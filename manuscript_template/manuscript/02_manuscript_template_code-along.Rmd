## I have commented out the default YAML "title" and removed the author and date 
## info as I don't really want them to appear on the title page

# title: "Generic Manuscript Template"

# This sets up the format to match most journal requirements of 1" margins
# and 12pt Times new Roman font. The catch is that to specify the font
# you have to use the xelatex latex_engine. Also important to note, most 
# journals need Word files (or Latex) for copy editing. You can simply
# comment out lines (20, 21, 23, 24 and 25) and uncomment the 
# word_document output on line 29. 
# 
geometry: margin=1in

## Specify your csl here. You can use local or remote 
## sources of csl files but local is better.
## below are two good sources of CSL files
## https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles
## https://www.zotero.org/styles

# csl: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citation-style-language/styles/master/ecology-letters.csl
# csl: https://www.zotero.org/styles/ecology-letters
csl: "../references/ecology-letters.csl"
# I've included a Nature CSL file so you can see how easy it is to change citation style
# csl: "../references/nature.csl"

# The .bib file allows you to add citations without Zotero and to share your
# library with co-authors so that everyone has the same list of potential
# references. Co-authors can just add new entries to the .bib file if they think
# a citation is relevant. You will know it is setup correctly because you will
# be able to select your references as you type in "Visual" mode.
bibliography: ../references/references.bib
